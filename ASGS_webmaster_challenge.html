		<h1>Yosemite National Park</h1>

	<div class="container">
		<h2>Yosemite National Park is definately one of the best national parks to go to. There's so many things to do there and the view is just breathtaking.</h2>
		<h3>Some of the best things to do in Yosemite is hiking to lower or upper Yosemite falls, ice skating in Curry Village, and visiting the Majestic hotel (Ahwahnee). You can also go to Tuolome Meadows or dip your feet into  the lake. Wherever you go, the view will be great.</h3>

		<h4>Upper Yosemite Falls</h4>
		<p6>
			Fun fact: there is an upper and lower Yosemite falls. In some places, you can actually view both the upper and lower Yosemite falls. The hike to upper Yosemite Falls is more strenuous. There is a lot of zigzagging left and right to get there, but the view is beautiful. It is a 7.6-mile hike round-trip, which usually takes around 6-10 hours.

		<h5>Lower Yosemite Falls</h5>
		<p7>The hike to lower Yosemite Falls is definately way easier than hiking to upper Yosemite falls. It is just a short easy walk, which makes it easier than if you were to hike to upper Yosemite Falls. It is a 1 mile trip, which takes around 30 minutes to do. From there you can definately see both lower and upper Yosemite Falls.</p7>

		<h6>Majectic (Ahwahnee) Hotel</h6>
		<p8>The Majestic hotel is at the east end of Yosemite Valley. It is a beautiful hotel that also has sort of a creepy vibe to it. It has a somewhat creepy vibe because the elevator scene from "The Shining" was filmed there. Not only that, but people have said they encountered paranormal activity there. Although there is the creepy-ish vibe, it is still a very beautiful hotel and a great place to visit.</p8>

		<h7>Bridalveil Falls</h7>
		<p9>Bridalveil Falls was actually named that because the Ahwahneechee tribe believed that it was home of a spirit that protected the valley. Not only that, but sometimes when the winds are strong the mist would look like a veil that a bride would wear. They believed that when inhaling the mist, it would increase one's chances of being married.</p9>
